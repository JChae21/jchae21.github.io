        I received a Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, where I worked with Professor David S. Ebert.
        I also received a B.S. in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering (Dual Major) from Kyung Hee University, South Korea.        
        During my doctoral research, I have focused on the visual analytics approach integrating human reasoning, data mining, and statistical techniques for knowledge discovery in big data, such as textual and spatiotemporal information in a large volume of social media.
