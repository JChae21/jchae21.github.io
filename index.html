	Hi, I am a Research Scientist in the <a href="https://csmd.ornl.gov/group/visualization" style="color:#338CFF;"> Visualization Group </a> in the Computer Science & Mathematics Division at the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/" style="color:#42C834;"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) </a>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My research focuses on <b>Visual Analytics</b> and <b>Human-computer interaction (HCI)</b> by combining <b>Human Analytical Capabilities</b> (e.g., visual processing and cognition) and <b>Data Analytics Techniques</b> (e.g., machine learning, and AI) for <b>human intelligence amplification</b>.
	My past and current work can be categorized into two parts: visual analytics for human-generated big data and visual analytics for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). My primary research goal was to develop visual analytics, where human analytical capabilities, such as visual processing and cognition and human-computer interaction (HCI), collaborated with other ML and statistical analytics techniques. Since I joined Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), my focus has been on supporting humans in leveraging visual analytics to analyze and understand the outputs of AI/ML models. These researches have been featured by a mechanism, “human-in-the-loop,” allowing humans to interact with machines continuously through visual methods.

	I earned my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" style="color:#BCA428;"> Purdue University </a> in 2016. My doctoral research was conducted under the direction of Prof. David S. Ebert. Before the doctoral study, I was a software engineer in many industrial fields: security, computer network, and electronic commerce.
