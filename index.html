	Hi, I am a Research Scientist in the <a href="https://csmd.ornl.gov/group/visualization" style="color:#338CFF;"> Visualization Group </a> in the Computer Science & Mathematics Division at the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/" style="color:#42C834;"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) </a>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I am interested in <b>human intelligence amplification to perform tasks that are too large or too complex to complete through visual computing</b>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My research focuses on building <b>Visual Analytics</b> and platforms by combining <b>Human Analytical Capabilities</b> (e.g., visual processing and cognition, and human-computer interaction) and <b>Data Analytics Techniques</b> (e.g., machine learning, data mining, and deep learning).
	Since I have joined ORNL, I have been focusing on visual analytics for enhancing human-understandable explanations of AI technologies. I have developed multiple visual analytics systems that help the developers understand their models and results and build insights to improve their models.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I earned my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" style="color:#BCA428;"> Purdue University </a> in 2016. My doctoral research was conducted under the direction of Prof. David S. Ebert. Before the doctoral study, I was a software engineer in many industrial fields: security, computer network, and electronic commerce.
